Introduction
------------

 This guide is designed for Ubuntu 16.04 and its derivatives (Linux Mint/Elementary OS/etc.).  Using this guide with Debian, or other Linux Distributions may/may not work.

 This guide was written in June/July 2016 shortly before 16.04.1 release and might have errors, or be obsolete by the time you read it. Doing research on how to fix issues, if they arise, is for you to do.

 We assume you are starting with a complete minimal Ubuntu installation. That can be accomplished via local terminal, or over ssh. It is also assumed you are not using the root account. If you are not starting with a fresh minimal install, you might run into problems. Google and the :ref:`help resources <help>` might be able to offer guidance.

 .. NOTE:: In this guide you will see commands formatted like this:

 .. code:: bash

  this is an example

 When you see these, you must type them into a command line interface (terminal window) as shown.

Introduction
============

So you have heard about nZEDb and want to give it try? The first step is to decide on what platform you want to use to host it. nZEDb is designed to run best on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Server.

Hardware wise, you can run it on just about anything. If you want to use nZEDb to its maximum potential, a dual core processor with 3GB of ram will do for smaller sites. For the absolute best performance, seperate servers to house the database and host the rest is advised. Setting that up is outside the scope of this documentation.
